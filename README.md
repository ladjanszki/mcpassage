# What is this?
The first passage time distribution for Brownian Motion

# TODO
- There should be a max and a min value the trajectory ever reached
- If negative value and smaller than min then add one to the given level
- If positive act value and larger than the max value add one to the given level
- Pandas is useless for this and a numpy array with sufficient index calculation should be used.
